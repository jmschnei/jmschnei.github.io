Education
======
* Ph.D in Multimodal Information Retrieval (Computer Science), University Carlos III of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, 2015
  * Title: New approaches to interactive multimedia content retrieval from different sources
  * Supervisors: Professor Dr. Paloma Martínez Fernández
  * Year: 2015
  * Grade: 10/10
  * Description: The development of this thesis aims to study the retrieval of multimedia information coming from different sources. Two things have been studied: the analysis of which sources are the most suitable to be requested and what are the best ways to manage the results obtained from each of them. An interesting effort has also been made in adapting IR functionality to user behavior by machine learning techniques (classification)
* M.S. in Computer Science (Specialized in Artificial Intelligence), University Carlos III of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, 2011
  * Title: Proposal for entities spell checking in voice queries in QA system
  * Supervisors: Professor Dr. Paloma Martínez Fernández
  * Year: 2011
  * Grade: 9.8/10
  * Description: This thesis explored the idea that the miss recognized entities present in a text transcribed by a ASR can be corrected using a pattern-based and dictionary-based system that obtains alternative entities using phonetic comparison
* B.S. in Telecommunications Engineering, University Carlos III of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, 2009
  * Title: Implementation in C++ of Kalman Filter for Sensor Fusion of Differential GPS and Inertial Measurement Unit
  * Supervisors: Professor Dr.-Ing. Thomas Sattel and Dipl.-Ing. Tobias Hesse
  * Year: 2007
  * Grade: 9/10
  * Description: This thesis explored the work done working in the Mechanical Engineering department of the University of Paderborn (Germany) collaborating with the German Aerospatial Center and Hella to create a self-driven car
* Erasmus Scholarship on Telecommunications Engineering, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany, 2006-2007
